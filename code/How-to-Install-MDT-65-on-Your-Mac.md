## How to Use MDT 6.5
 
To use MDT 6.5, you need to have a Windows server that runs the MDT 6.5 server components, such as the Deployment Workbench, the Deployment Share, and the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK). You also need to have a network boot environment that supports the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) protocol, such as Windows Deployment Services (WDS) or a third-party solution.
 
Once you have set up your MDT 6.5 server and network boot environment, you can use the MDT 6.5 client on your Mac to connect to the MDT 6.5 server and perform various deployment tasks, such as:

- Creating and capturing custom Windows images.
- Applying Windows images to your target computers.
- Injecting drivers and applications into your Windows images.
- Customizing your Windows settings and configuration.
- Running scripts and commands before and after the deployment process.

To connect to the MDT 6.5 server from your Mac, you need to enter the IP address or hostname of the server, as well as the username and password of an account that has access to the Deployment Share. You can also specify additional options, such as the deployment task sequence, the computer name, and the domain join credentials.
